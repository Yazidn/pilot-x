## Notes
- Fixes and new features are being added from time to time.
- This is a re-write of [pilot](https://github.com/Yazidn/pilot-alpha). using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) this time, the goal with this was for it to be a small component of a bigger project that i haven't started working on yet.
