# pilot-x
A rewrite of pilot. using Svelte this time, the goal with this was for it to be a small component of a bigger project
that i haven't started working on yet.

# Features
- Stay up to date with where you left off.
- Keep a "wishlist" of things you want to watch in the future, and never forget.
- Automatic search and autocomplete, adding a series is very straightforward.
- It gets the job done, nothing more.
- The ability to set a link of your liking for each show for quick access, unclutter your bookmarks.
- A bit of customization so you feel in control, to a certain degree.
